## ðŸ“– Study Purpose

This project explores the transcriptional impact of two traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) interventionsâ€”one enriched with **extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)** and the other with **nuts**â€”on gene expression related to **neuroinflammation** and **cardiovascular risk**. The analyses were performed using data from a sub-cohort (n = 134) of the larger **PREDIMED trial**.

We evaluated key inflammation-related genes (e.g., *CDKN2A*, *IFNG*, *TGFB2*, *NAMPT*, *NLRP3*) at baseline and after a 12-month intervention using qRT-PCR techniques.
